# 🏦 Loan Risk Analytics — EDA Case Study

## 📘 Overview  
This project explores **loan risk analytics** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to understand how financial institutions can use data to identify high-risk applicants and minimize loan defaults.

---

## 💼 Business Context  
A consumer finance company faces two major risks while lending:  
1. **Rejecting creditworthy applicants** → loss of business.  
2. **Approving risky applicants** → financial loss.  

Using EDA, we analyze applicant and loan data to uncover patterns that help improve loan approval strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Identify key factors that indicate whether a client may face **payment difficulties**.  
These insights can guide decisions such as:  
- Loan approval or rejection,  
- Adjusting loan amounts, or  
- Setting interest rates based on risk.
